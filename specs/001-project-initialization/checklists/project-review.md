## Notes

- This checklist contains 170 items organized into 20 categories covering all aspects of requirements quality
- Primary focus areas: Completeness (gaps in requirements), Clarity (ambiguous terms), Consistency (cross-document and internal alignment), Coverage (missing scenarios), and Traceability (alignment with original request)
- Critical gaps identified: Exception handling, recovery flows, security requirements, testing approach, package inter-dependencies, migration paths
- Many items marked with [Gap] indicate areas where requirements may need to be added or clarified
- Items marked with [Ambiguity] or [Potential Conflict] require resolution or clarification
- Traceability section validates alignment with the original Russian request to ensure all key points are addressed
- The specification is strong in core architecture requirements but has gaps in operational, security, and advanced scenario coverage
